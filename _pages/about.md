I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan (UMich), advised by [Samet Oymak](https://sota.engin.umich.edu/). I expect to complete my degree in Spring 2025. Before joining UMich, I worked with Samet Oymak at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) starting in Fall 2020. I earned my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019 and my Master’s degree from UCR in 2020.

My research focuses on developing impactful machine learning methods and uncovering their underlying mechanisms. I currently focus on the mathematical understanding of sequence models and exploring the emergent behaviors in generative models. I am always open to new research directions in advancing AI and reducing human labor.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, climbing, and trying out new activities (and, of course, researching :blush:).
