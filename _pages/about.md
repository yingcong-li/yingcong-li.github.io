I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I earned my Ph.D. from Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, advised by Dr. [Samet Oymak](https://sota.engin.umich.edu/). 

Our group focuses on developing impactful AI methods and uncovering the fundamental principles behind their success.
<ul> 
  <li>Mathematical foundations of sequence models</li> 
  <li>Emergent abilities in LLMs</li> 
  <li>Advancing data and compute efficiency</li> 
  <li>Interdisciplinary collaboration in building scientific foundation models</li> 
</ul>

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and trying out new activities (and, of course, researching :blush:).
